# About me -_-
Hi! My name is Mr Blackest. I'm a regular person who loves programming. I'm a web programmer. Don't even ask me why so much, I won't reveal what kind of tea I prefer. At first glance, I may seem aggressive, but deep down I am a calm person (at least I hope so). If I set a goal for myself, I will pursue it to the end -_-.
